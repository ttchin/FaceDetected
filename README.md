# FaceDetected

A project based on tensor flow running on raspberry that can detect face.

## Requirements

1. Raspberrypi 3
1. Camera
1. Speaker
1. Python 3.5
1. Lots of images of the target and others
1. Put the images into data/target and others

## Prepare environments

### Prefer to train models on PC:

### In windows and macos, opencv only works on python 3.5

1. `conda create -n 3.5.2 python=3.5.2`
1. `conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3`
1. `conda install h5py`
1. `conda install scipy`
1. `pip install keras`
1. `pip install sklearn`
1. `pip install tensorflow`

### Install on raspberry

### In raspberry, opencv only works on python 3.4**
